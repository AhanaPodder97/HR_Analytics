Workforce Analytics helps us with interpreting organizational data. It finds the people-related trends in the data and allows the HR Department to take the appropriate steps to keep the organization running smoothly and profitably. Attrition in a corporate setup is one of the complex challenges that the people managers and the HRs personnel have to deal with. 

This project is designed to provide insights into key metrics and trends related to human resource management in an organization. The dashboard utilizes visualizations and data analysis techniques to help HR professionals identify patterns and make data-driven decisions. The dashboard includes several key visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of HR-related metrics, including employee turnover rate, headcount, and employee engagement levels.
