Workforce Analytics helps us with interpreting organizational data. It finds the people-related trends in the data and allows the HR Department to take the appropriate steps to keep the organization running smoothly and profitably. Attrition in a corporate setup is one of the complex challenges that the people managers and the HRs personnel have to deal with. 

This Workforce analytics Tableau project is designed to equip HR managers and business leaders with a powerful tool for analyzing and monitoring employee data, enabling data-driven decisions related to retention, development, and recruitment. The project includes trendlines and target lines to help track progress toward reducing attrition, as well as charts displaying the distribution of employees and attrition rates by gender, age group, job satisfaction, and education field. The interactive features, including legends and filters, allow HR managers to drill down into the data for deeper insights and more informed decision-making.

3.	Address the concerns of employees in the age group of 28-32, who have the highest attrition rate, and provide them with better opportunities for career growth and development.
4.	Conduct a review of the job roles with the highest attrition rate, such as Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists, to identify the reasons behind the high attrition rate and take necessary steps to address these concerns.
5.	Provide training and development opportunities for employees to help them enhance their skills and progress in their careers, which can improve job satisfaction and reduce attrition.
